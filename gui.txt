1. Window GUI

The application window should contain three major components:
a. A textbox for user input, of any logical statement, such as (A /\ B) -> C.
b. A label for displaying any error of the given statement. Eg, statement is invalid, at the place near "/\ BC) ->".
c. A display of logic truth table of the given statement.



2. Logic Truth Table

The logic truth table should be dynamically generated according to the given statement. 
Thus, the number of columns and rows are dynamic. 

The table are mainly seperated into two parts:
a. On the left size, all the variables and there truth values are displayed. Eg. A, B, C are corresponding to T, T, T, etc.
b. On the right side, the truth values of the variables and symbols are displayed. Eg. (A /\ B) -> C is corresponding to T T T T T, etc.

A  B  C  |  (A /\ B) -> C
--------------------------------
T  T  T  |  T   T T  T  T
T  T  F  |  T   T T  F  F
T  F  T  |  T   T F  T  F
T  F  F  |  T   T F  F  F
F  T  T  |  F   F T  T  T
F  T  F  |  F   F T  F  F
F  F  T  |  F   F F  T  F
F  F  F  |  F   F F  F  F

a. Select the best-fitting Pane as root
b. Table Row should be put into a seperate FXML file for better readability and reusability
c. Table should contain many Row component
d. Give fxid for each of these components



3. Table Row

Each table Row should contain many columns. The number of columns is dynamic as well.
For example, (A /\ B) -> C has 7 columns. The columns are: (, A, /\, B, ), ->, and C.

TableRowController.java should have a method: public void setRow(ArrayList<Character> truthValues)
This method will take an ArrayList of truth values which each value would always be one of 'T', 'F' or null. 
The null value represents anything that takes place in the statement but does not have any actual truth value. Such as brackets.
For instance, truthValues = {null, 'T', 'T', 'T', null, 'T', 'T'} is corresponding to:
  (   A /\ B   )    ->    C
null  T  T T  null   T    T

For displaying, null value would just be empty space, nothing shows in the table, whereas for 'T' and 'F', showing them in the table.



4. Result

Eventually there should be following files:

a. Window.fxml
b. TableRow.fxml
c. WindowController.java
d. TableRowController.java
